# Marco Ramirez Portfolio

## tech used:

this project was bootstrapped with [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<<<<<<< HEAD
i used react-router for the first time while making this, in order to make this multi-page. i genuinely had a blast, and am glad i can most likely use this in the future.

i plan to update this every time i complete a project that i'm proud of, whether it be course based or personal.

i also plan to update this site itself, so if you're reading this (for some reason) and have a design idea/gripe, please send it my way

i really really focused on responsive design this time, thank you to my family members and friends for letting me constantly check how it looked on their phones. you are the best : )
