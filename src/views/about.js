                    <p>Hello! I'm Marco Ramirez, and I am currently a sophomore
                        attending Indianapolis University Purdue University (IUPUI). 
                        I'm majoring in Media Arts and Science, and specializing in Web Design.</p>
                    <p>My first time experiencing web design was back in high school, as I 
                        started to mess around with the source code of websites that I frequented. 
                        I remember viewing a javascript file using the sources tab in DevTools, and
                        then I remember being the most confused I had ever been. From that point on,
                        I was enamored with the concept of web design.</p>
                    <p>Soon after, I started to experiment with basic HTML and CSS. Though the things
                        I made didn't look good whatsoever, they were still small steps in a very long
                        road. Fast forward to current day, and I feel like I've started to get the hang
                        of a variety of front-end development tools.</p>
